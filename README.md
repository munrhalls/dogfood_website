This is my first, experimental website.

Live: <strong>https://dogfoodhalls.netlify.app</strong>

Static, contains HTML/CSS only. Fully RWD, though.

It has a ton of flaws and very poorly organized code because I created it before properly learning from courses/tutorials. The decision was to teach myself as much about HTML/CSS (additionally about googling & using docs) as possible by jumping right into action and to see what/how much I don't know, as oppossed to studying theory and tutorials first.
